            <h2>Provider</h2>
            <p>Dabinuss</p>
            <p>dabinuss@gmail.com</p>

            <h2>1. Scope and acceptance</h2>
            <p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your installation and use of the desktop application "Dabis Content Manager" (the "App"). By downloading, installing, accessing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms.</p>

            <h3>2. The App (local-first)</h3>
            <p>The App is a local desktop application that helps you prepare, manage, and upload videos and related metadata to YouTube. Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the App, the App does not operate first-party servers for content processing or uploads. Uploads and API requests are made directly between your device and Google/YouTube.</p>

            <h3>3. Eligibility</h3>
            <p>You may use the App only if you are legally capable of forming a binding contract where you live. The App is not intended for children. If you are a parent/guardian and believe a child is using the App, contact us at dabinuss@gmail.com.</p>

            <h3>4. License and ownership</h3>
            <p>4.1 License. We grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for your own lawful purposes in accordance with these Terms.</p>
            <p>4.2 Ownership. We (and our licensors) retain all rights, title, and interest in and to the App, including all intellectual property rights, except where otherwise stated. Your content remains yours.</p>

            <h3>5. Your content and responsibilities</h3>
            <p>5.1 Rights. You are solely responsible for the videos, thumbnails, titles, descriptions, tags, and any other materials you upload ("Content"). You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights, permissions, and consents to use and upload your Content, and that your Content does not infringe any third-party rights (including copyright, privacy, or publicity rights).</p>
            <p>5.2 Compliance. You agree to comply with all applicable laws and all YouTube policies that apply to your Content and uploads (including YouTube's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines).</p>
            <p>5.3 Security. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of any API keys, OAuth client credentials, and access tokens stored on your device or used with the App. Do not share them.</p>

            <h3>6. YouTube / Google API Services (third-party)</h3>
            <p>6.1 Third-party services. The App integrates with YouTube via the YouTube Data API and related Google services ("Google/YouTube Services"). Your use of Google/YouTube Services is governed by Google's and YouTube's terms and policies.</p>
            <p>6.2 YouTube Terms of Service. By using the App's YouTube features, you acknowledge and agree that you are also bound by the YouTube Terms of Service.</p>
            <p>6.3 Required upload notice (must be shown on the upload screen). If you use the App to upload videos to YouTube, the screen/window where you click the "upload" button must display the following warning:</p>
            <p>"By clicking 'upload,' you certify that the content you are uploading complies with the YouTube Terms of Service (including the YouTube Community Guidelines) at https://www.youtube.com/t/terms. Please be sure not to violate others' copyright or privacy rights."</p>
            <p>(If you implement uploads on mobile devices, use the mobile terms URL specified by YouTube.)</p>
            <p>6.4 OAuth permissions. When you connect a Google account, you grant the App access only to the scopes you approve during Google's authorization flow. You can revoke access at any time in your Google Account settings (see our Privacy Policy for details).</p>

            <h3>7. Prohibited use</h3>
            <p>You must not:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the App for unlawful, infringing, deceptive, or abusive activity;</li>
                <li>Circumvent or attempt to circumvent security, quotas, or access restrictions imposed by Google/YouTube;</li>

            <h3>8. Updates and changes to the App</h3>
            <p>We may modify, update, suspend, or discontinue the App (in whole or in part) at any time. Some features may change due to changes in Google/YouTube Services.</p>

            <h3>9. Disclaimers</h3>
            <p>9.1 The App is provided "as is" and "as available". To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>
            <p>9.2 We do not guarantee uninterrupted operation, successful uploads, compatibility with every device, or availability of any Google/YouTube feature or API.</p>

            </ul>
            <p>Nothing in these Terms limits liability that cannot be limited under applicable law (for example, certain liabilities for intent, gross negligence, or mandatory consumer rights).</p>

            <h3>11. Indemnity</h3>
            <p>You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims, damages, liabilities, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or related to your Content, your use of the App, or your violation of these Terms or any third-party rights.</p>

            <h3>12. Termination</h3>
            <p>You may stop using the App at any time. We may suspend or terminate your license to use the App if you materially breach these Terms. Upon termination, you must stop using the App and delete it from your devices.</p>

            <h3>13. Governing law and venue</h3>
            <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Germany, excluding conflict-of-law rules. If you are a consumer in the EEA/UK, you may also benefit from mandatory protections of your local law.</p>

            <h3>14. Changes to these Terms</h3>
